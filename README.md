## What is 'I-Spy' ?
I-Spy is a bot which keeps a check on foul language, hate-speech and NSFW content on platforms like discord and twitter.
A warning is dropped when our bot comes across similar content.
I-spy is the one stop solution to monitor your discord servers and twitter handles against community demons and helps in content moderation.


## What problem does it solve ?
Since the boom of the internet, we have seen an exponential rise in spread of foul language and hate-speech across all social media platforms. This is an honest effort to 
filter what you see and keep your loved ones gaurded against venom spewed by keyboard demons. Don't fret about hateful/NSFW content because we got your back! 

## How does it work ?
We used a publicly available Kaggle dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/vkrahul/twitter-hate-speech?select=train_E6oV3lV.csv ) for developing an 
NLP hate speech detection model. We used a basic Logistic Regression model for our purpose , which gave us an accuracy of about 85%. We also used numerous Python
libraries/modules like stopwords and Tf-Idf vectorization for data cleaning .
